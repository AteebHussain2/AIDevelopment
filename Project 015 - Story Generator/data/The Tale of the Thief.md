Once upon a time, there was a man who was tricked by a thief into giving him his money. The man was very angry, and he vowed to get his revenge.

The next day, the man went to the thief's house and pretended to be a friend. He told the thief that he had found a treasure, and that he wanted to share it with him.

The thief was greedy, and he believed the man. He followed the man to a forest, where the man had dug a hole.

The man told the thief to climb down into the hole to get the treasure. The thief climbed down, and the man quickly covered the hole with dirt.

The thief was trapped in the hole, and the man laughed at him. "Tit for tat," he said. "You tricked me, so I tricked you."

The thief was very angry, but he could not get out of the hole. He stayed there for days, until he finally starved to death.

The man was happy that he had gotten his revenge, but he also felt sorry for the thief. He realized that revenge was not the best way to solve problems.

From that day on, the man vowed to never take revenge on anyone again. He learned that it is better to forgive and forget.
