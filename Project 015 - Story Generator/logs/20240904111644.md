Once upon a time, there was a fox and a crane who were friends. One day, the fox invited the crane to his house for dinner. The fox served the soup in a flat dish, which made it difficult for the crane to eat. The crane was very hungry, but he could not get any of the soup. The fox ate all of the soup himself and then licked his lips.

The crane was very angry, but he did not say anything. He waited until the next day, and then he invited the fox to his house for dinner. The crane served the soup in a tall, narrow vase. The fox could not get his tongue into the vase to eat the soup. The crane ate all of the soup himself and then licked his lips.

The fox was very angry, but he did not say anything. He waited until the next day, and then he invited the crane to his house for dinner again. This time, the fox served the soup in a bowl that was just the right size. The fox and the crane both ate their soup and enjoyed their meal.

The fox and the crane learned a valuable lesson that day. They learned that it is important to be kind to others, even if they have been unkind to you. They also learned that it is important to forgive others, even if they have wronged you.
