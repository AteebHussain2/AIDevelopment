Once upon a time, there was a camel and a fox who were very good friends and very good thieves. One day, the two friends decided to cross a river so that they could travel to a nearby village. The camel was much larger than the fox, so he agreed to carry the fox on his back.

The camel and the fox set off on their journey, and soon they came to the river. The camel waded into the water, and the fox climbed onto his back. The camel began to swim across the river, but when they reached the middle, the fox suddenly pushed the camel off his back and swam away.

The camel was shocked and dismayed. He had never expected his friend to betray him like this. He struggled to swim to the shore, but the current was strong, and he was soon swept away.

The fox watched as the camel disappeared beneath the waves. He felt a twinge of guilt, but he quickly dismissed it. He had what he wanted, and that was all that mattered.

The fox continued on his journey, and soon he reached the village. He went to the market square and began to steal food from the stalls. The villagers were angry, and they chased the fox out of town.

The fox ran and ran until he came to a forest. He was tired and hungry, and he soon fell asleep under a tree.

As the fox slept, the camel came out of the forest. He had been swept downstream by the current, but he had managed to swim to shore. He was weak and exhausted, but he was still alive.

The camel saw the fox sleeping under the tree, and he was filled with anger. He remembered how the fox had betrayed him, and he decided to get revenge.

The camel kicked the fox awake, and then he began to beat him. He kicked and punched the fox until he was bloody and bruised.

The fox begged for mercy, but the camel was relentless. He continued to beat the fox until he was dead.

The camel finally stopped beating the fox, and he stood over his body. He felt a sense of satisfaction, but he also felt a sense of sadness. He had lost his friend, and he knew that he would never be able to trust anyone again.

The camel turned and walked away, leaving the fox's body behind. He walked for many days until he came to another village. He stayed in the village for a while, and he began to heal from his wounds.

The camel never forgot what the fox had done to him, and he never forgave him. He learned a valuable lesson that day: never trust a thief.
