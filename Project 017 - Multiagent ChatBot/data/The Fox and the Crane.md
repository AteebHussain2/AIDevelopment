Once upon a time, there was a fox and a crane who were friends. One day, the fox invited the crane to a feast. The fox served the crane soup, but the soup was too hot for the crane to eat. The crane was very angry, and he vowed to get revenge on the fox.

The next day, the crane invited the fox to a feast. The crane served the fox a fish, but the fish was too big for the fox to swallow. The fox was very angry, and he vowed to get revenge on the crane.

The fox and the crane continued to get revenge on each other, until finally, they were both so weak that they could not even stand. They realized that their revenge had been a waste of time, and they decided to forgive each other.

The fox and the crane learned a valuable lesson that day. They learned that revenge is a self-destructive cycle, and that it is better to forgive and forget than to seek revenge.
