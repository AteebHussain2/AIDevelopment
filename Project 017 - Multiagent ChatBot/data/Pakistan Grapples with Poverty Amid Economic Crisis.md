**Pakistan Grapples with Poverty Amid Economic Crisis**

Pakistan is facing a severe economic crisis, with inflation soaring to 29.66% in December 2023, according to the Pakistan Bureau of Statistics. The World Bank estimates that Pakistan's poverty rate is 37.2% as of 2023, with 12.5 million more people falling below the poverty line in just one year.

The economic crisis has led to widespread job losses and wage cuts, making it difficult for people to meet their basic needs. The government has implemented austerity measures to reduce spending, but these measures have had a negative impact on social welfare programs and public services.

The World Bank has warned that Pakistan's poverty rate could rise to 40.1% by 2024 if the economic crisis continues. The government has announced a new budget that includes measures to address poverty, such as increasing social welfare spending and providing subsidies for food and energy.

However, critics argue that the budget does not go far enough to address the root causes of poverty in Pakistan, such as corruption and inequality. The United Nations has called on the international community to provide assistance to Pakistan to help it address the economic crisis and reduce poverty.

The government has launched a number of initiatives to address poverty, including the Ehsaas program, which provides cash transfers to poor families. Despite these efforts, poverty remains a major challenge in Pakistan, and the economic crisis is only making the situation worse.

The international community must step up and provide assistance to Pakistan to help it address the economic crisis and reduce poverty. The government must also take steps to address the root causes of poverty, such as corruption and inequality. Only then can Pakistan hope to make progress in reducing poverty and improving the lives of its people.
