# Smart Study Planner

## Overview
**Smart Study Planner** is a web-based application designed to help students create and manage effective study schedules. By considering the user's time availability, preferred subjects, and specific goals, the application generates a personalized study plan that maximizes productivity and learning outcomes.

Built with Python and a user-friendly frontend using Streamlit.

## Key Features

- **Customizable Study Schedules:**
  Users can input their available time slots, subjects to study, and specific learning goals (such as chapters to cover or practice sessions). The planner then creates a dynamic schedule that adapts to these preferences.

- **Priority-Based Scheduling:**
  A rule-based algorithm prioritizes subjects based on user-defined criteria, such as difficulty level, upcoming exam dates, or personal preferences.

- **Time Management Tips:**
  Provides helpful time management tips, such as Pomodoro sessions, suggested break intervals, and focused study techniques.

- **Calendar Integration:**
  Integrates with Google Calendar or Outlook to sync study schedules, sending reminders and notifications directly to the user's calendar.

- **Progress Tracking:**
  Tracks the user's progress over time, allowing them to visualize which subjects need more attention and adjust their study plan accordingly.

- **Printable Reports:**
  Generates a printable version of the study plan or a progress report that can be shared with mentors or friends.

## Technical Stack

- **Frontend:** Streamlit for a responsive and interactive user interface.
- **Backend:** Python, using rule-based logic and scheduling algorithms.
- **Data Handling:** Utilizes `pandas` for data management and processing.
- **API Integrations:** Google Calendar API or Outlook API to sync schedules and send notifications.
- **Deployment:** Deployable on platforms like Streamlit Cloud, Heroku, or AWS for easy access and sharing.

## Why Choose This Project?

- **Practical and Useful:** A study planner is a practical tool that many students and professionals would find helpful for managing their time effectively.
- **Scalable and Expandable:** There is plenty of room for future enhancements, such as task suggestions, collaborative planning, and advanced analytics.
