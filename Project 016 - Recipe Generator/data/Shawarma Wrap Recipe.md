**Shawarma Wrap Recipe**

**Ingredients**:

* 1 pound boneless, skinless chicken breasts, sliced into thin strips
* 1 tablespoon olive oil
* 1 teaspoon ground cumin
* 1 teaspoon ground coriander
* 1 teaspoon paprika
* 1/2 teaspoon salt
* 1/4 teaspoon black pepper
* 1/4 cup plain yogurt
* 1/4 cup chopped fresh parsley
* 1/4 cup chopped fresh cilantro
* 1/4 cup chopped red onion
* 1/4 cup chopped tomatoes
* 1/4 cup chopped cucumbers
* 4 pita breads
* Tahini sauce, for serving (optional)

**Instructions**:

1. In a large bowl, combine the chicken, olive oil, cumin, coriander, paprika, salt, and pepper. Stir to coat evenly.
2. Cover and refrigerate for at least 30 minutes, or up to overnight.
3. Heat a large skillet or grill pan over medium-high heat.
4. Add the chicken and cook, stirring occasionally, until cooked through and slightly browned, about 5-7 minutes.
5. Remove the chicken from the pan and set aside.
6. To assemble the wraps, spread a layer of tahini sauce on each pita bread.
7. Top with the chicken, parsley, cilantro, red onion, tomatoes, and cucumbers.
8. Roll up the wraps and serve immediately.

**Variations and Tips**:

* For a vegetarian shawarma wrap, substitute chickpeas or other plant-based proteins for the chicken.
* Add crispy potatoes to the wrap for an extra layer of texture.
* Pickle the vegetables for a tangy flavor.
* Serve the wraps with additional toppings, such as hummus, zhoug jalape√±o paste, or pickled onions.
* To make the wraps ahead of time, assemble them and wrap them tightly in plastic wrap. Refrigerate for up to 24 hours. When ready to serve, reheat in the microwave or oven until warmed through.
